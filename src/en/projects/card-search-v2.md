# Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Searching App (version 2)

## üîç Project Overview

A card searching app for the Yu-Gi-Oh! (YGO) trading card game. Following in the foot steps of [version 1](/en/projects/card-search-v1.html), version 2 comes with the following improvements:
1. It is now possible to search for a card by ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù name and level/rank/link value instead of just the exact name.
2. UI now includes icons for all card properties and card art.
3. Better looking UI (inspired by the [Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel Meta](https://www.masterduelmeta.com/) website).

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Redux

<p class="back-to-top">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### üìÅ Creating a `types` folder

The most common covention is to create the `types` folder within the `src` directory. Files here end with the `.types.ts` extension. For example:
```bash
<your project name>/
    |- public/
    |- src/
        |- components/
        |- features/
        |- types/
            |- card.type.ts
            |- seachControls.type.ts
```

<p class="back-to-top">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### üîß Modifying the `config` files to allow for the use of aliases

1. The first step is to modify the `tsconfig.app.json` file by adding the following, under the `compilerOptions`:
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        // more properties here...
        "baseUrl": "./src",
        "paths": {
            "@/*": ["./*"],
            "@components/*": ["components/*"],
            "@features/*": ["features/*"],
            "@utils/*": ["utils/*"]
        }
    }
}
```

2. Then, within your terminal, run the following command in the root directory of your project:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

3. Then open your `tsconfig.node.json` file and ensure it has the following under the `compilerOptions`:
```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        // more properties here...
        "types": ["node"]
    }
}
```

4. And finally, modify your `vite.config.ts` file as such:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import path from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'),
    },
  },
});
```

All of these modifications allows us to import any necessary types as such:
```ts
import type { <type name> } from "@/types/<file name>.types";
```

Instead of:
```ts
import type { <type name> } from "../types/<file name>.types";
```

‚ùó **Note:** I think I might have messed up here, originally all of these modifications were intended to achieve something like this:
```ts
import type { <type name> } from "@types/<file name>.types";
```

But despite spending hours on this issue and using AI to help me, I was only able to achieve the first import style.

#### ü§ì Using Union Types and Implementing Interfaces

An example of a type file using interfaces and union types:
```ts
// /src/types/searchControls.types.ts

export type SearchType = string | [number, number] | null; // => a union type
// SearchType can be assigned a string, tuple ([number, number]) or null

export interface SearchControls {
    searchBy: string,
    searchTerm: SearchTerm  // => using the union type in an interface
};
```

<p class="back-to-top">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### üí™ Extending Interfaces

Since I knew somewhat the shape of the data that would be returned from the YGOPRODeck API, I created a "base" card interface which could then be extended:
```ts
// /src/types/card.types.ts

export interface BaseCard {
    name: string,
    type: string,
    frameType: string,
    desc: string,
    card_images: CardImages[],
    race: string,
    humanReadableCardType: string,
    [key: string]: unknown
};

// ...

export interface MonsterCard extends BaseCard {
    typeline: string[],
    atk: number,            // When -1, then attack = "?"
    def: number | null,     // When -1, then defense = "?" (null for link monsters)
    attribute: string,
    level: number | null,   // Also includes Rank (null for link monsters)
    linkval? : number,      // Only applicable to link monsters
    pend_desc?: string,     // Only applicable to pendulum monsters
    monster_desc?: string   // Only applicable to pendulum monsters
};
```

If you've ever done object oriented programming, the concept is the same with the `MonsterCard` object inheriting all the properties of `BaseCard`.

Also, `[key: string]: unknown` is to allow for additionally properties of unknown shape.

##### ‚öîÔ∏è Optional Properties vs Allowing for `null`

You might have noticed that in the `MonsterCard` interface above, I have some properties, such as `def` as being "nullable", and I have some, such as `linkval` that are defined as optional (marked with a `?`) - what is the difference?
Using YGO here to explain; in the game, all monster cards have a defense (DEF) property, with the exception of Link monsters, who instead have a link value (LINK). The way how the YGOPRODeck deals with this is by **always** returning the `def` property for monster cards but making it `null` for link monsters. On the other side, the `linkval` property is ONLY for link monsters, thus making it **optional**.

##### ‚öîÔ∏è `any` vs `unknown`

As you might alway know, TypeScript offers some solutions to work with values of unknown type or shape. You can either decide to opt out of type checking altogether by annotating your variable with the `any` keyword, or you can use `unknown`. The latter is generally considered safer as `unknown` does **not** opt you out of type checking and instead forces you to check the type of the variable before you can use it.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è A word of Caution when working with "nullable" variables

I thought I was being smart by allowing certain values to be `null` in my project, and honestly, it makes sense in practice. For example, going back to the `searchTerm` variable shown above, which is supposed to hold any necessary parameters when fetching card data. For example, if the user desires to search for a card by exact name, then `searchTerm` holds a `string` value corresponding to the card name being searched. However, my original plan for the app included the option for the user to be able to simply view a random card. In this case, they do **not** need to provide any additional parameters. Therefore, it makes sense to set the `searchTerm` to `null`, to explicitly indicate to any developer that we are not expecting a value for it, rather than assigning an empty string to it, which might be ambiguous.
What I had failed to anticipate however was that, I would need to validate each individual "nullable" variable before I could use it, adding a lot of complexity to the project. The way how I dealt with this at first was by accommodating for the possibility of `null` everywhere I would use a "nullable" variable. For example, let's say with a component that accepts props for some internal logic, I would write something like this:
```ts
// /src/components/ViewCard.tsx

// assume a monsterCard variable of type MonsterCard has been defined above
{("def" in monsterCard && monsterCard.def !== null) && 
    <MonsterDEF def={monsterCard.def} />
}
```

‚ùó **Note:** I had to explicitly check by comparing `monsterCard.def` to `null`. This is because, `def` is a numeric value which can sometimes be equal to 0. When that happens, it is treated as a "falsy" value instead of checking whether it is equal to `null` or not, leading to unexpected behaviors.

Then in the `MonsterDEF` component, I would accommodate for the "nullable" `def` value as such:
```ts
// /src/components/MonsterDEF.tsx

interface MonsterDEFProps {
    def: number | null
};

const MonsterDEF: React.FC<MonsterDEFProps> = ({ def }) => {
    // ...
};
```

However, this is less than ideal in the long run as it causes a significant amount of code duplication.
Later (and by that I mean, much later), I did come up with a better solution for dealing with "nullable" values which involved using local variables as "pass by". For example, if you look at the `src/types/cardData.types.ts` file, you will see that I have defined an `error` property which can either be equal to a `string` value or `null`. When using it in the `src/App.tsx` file, I simply defined a local `error` variable to keep track of the error state:
```ts
// /src/App.tsx

// omitted logic for brevity...

const errorMessage = useSelector(getErrorMessage);  // => error state from store
const [error, setError] = useState("");             // => local error variable
const failedToLoad = useSelector(failedToLoadcards);
```

Then we can keep track of changes in the error state using a `useEffect` hook:
```ts
// /src/App.tsx

// ...

useEffect(() => {
    if (failedToLoad && errorMessage) {
        setError(errorMessage);
    } else {
        setError("");
    }
}, [failedToLoad, dispatch]);
```

Then all we need to worry about is the `failedToLoad` state:
```ts
// /src/App.tsx

// ...

{failedToLoad && <Error error={error} />}
```

Then in the ```Error``` component:
```ts
// /src/components/Error.tsx

interface ErrorProps {
    error: string   // => no need to worry about null!
}
```

üò¨ Admittedly, the use of `useEffect` hooks could add unnecessary overhead and impact the performance of your app. However, in my case, I believed the trade off was worth it by making my code more manageable and cleaner.
